# Arora Privacy Policy

## Last updated: 27 June, 2021

This policy sums up all you need to know about what data we store, what we use 
it for and what you can do about it.

## Stored in a Database

- Roblox user IDs: used to indicate admins and targets for infractions and other
  structures like trainings.
- Discord user IDs: used to link tickets and persistent roles to guild members.
- Parts of message contents: these are always provided by the user and are used 
  for infraction reasons and as additional notes on several structures.

The database is hosted on a server residing in The Netherlands.

## Stored in Cache

The Discord.js library automatically caches many things that come from Discord 
directly, they can range from avatars to message contents, to meta parameters 
such as role colors, names, user tags, user flags (badges). Most of this content
is used to provide logs or command output, and is deleted on bot shutdown, as it
is put into a volatile storage.

## Stored in Discord

Output of bot commands that is sent to Discord may include things like names, 
IDs and icons/avatars. This data cannot be deleted by us as there is no feasible
way to do so.

The staff of the servers the bot is in have control over if logs are sent, in
what channel they are sent and who has permission to see these channels.

## Requesting Data Deletion

To request deletion of your data, please contact the Staff in the bot's 
[support server][1]. If you are banned from that server and still want to use 
your right to deletion, you can instead DM a Staff member through friend 
requests or mutual servers. Your data is ensured to be deleted within 14 days 
from your request.

## Data Security

To ensure no data is unintentionally lost, the Staff will have to verify a few 
things, such as:
- Any user may request deletion of infractions of which they were the 
  responsible moderator of.
- You may not request deletion of infractions that target you, unless consent is
  given by the regarding server's owner.

The Arora Staff reserves the right to modify or delete any data at any given 
time, without notice or warning.
